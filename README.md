# Windows 10 Lite X86
Windows 10 Lite X86 is a 32-Bit Lightweight Operating System software developed by @MAXNETAR. He's available in some social media like in YouTube. Most of some developed us and he had hardtime to develop this.
This software includes Microsoft Office 2016 Pro Plus, AOL Instant Messenger, AnyDesk, and some ISO editing and burning softwares and File Unlocker! and default browser is Firefox
This software is pre-activated copy
It's very free to use!
Also it was first launched 32-Bit. there's a fun fact is it was developed using a Low End Computer... with 892MB of ram and 20-32GB Hard Disk with no Graphics Card. We talked about the 32-Bit Development
It requires may 892MB of ram but We think 1GB or 2GB ram will be better to run this system. and 16GB atleast requried, but 20GB and up is better for more workings!
Please try it to a Low Configuration!
